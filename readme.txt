Detects the use of ad blockers, restricts access with overlay and displays a notice to turn off ad-blocker.

== Description ==
Loads a file called banner_ads_300_250.js, a name routinely blocked by ad-blockers. If the file load is blocked it restricts access with overlay and displays a notice to turn off ad-blocker. Website access is restricted until ad-blocker is disabled and page reloaded. Extremely light weight, just a few lines of code.
 
If you are using Google Analytics, here is code to track your website's ad blocking events to add to your Google Analytics tag. Place inside the &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tags:
if(!document.getElementById('VbatOlNCpWPT')){
gtag('event', 'blocking_ads', {
'event_label': 'Blocking Ads',
'event_category': 'blocking_ads',
'non_interaction': true
});}

== Installation ==

* Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Once you have completed these steps you're done. Now turn on your AdBlock and visit your site to test the plugin!
 
== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= Are there any settings that I need to configure? =
 
Nope. Just activate the plugin. That's all.

= Does the banner_ads_300_250.js file contain any ads? =

No it does not. Ad blockers routinely block files that are named ads, banners, common ad sizes, etc. The file is used as bait. As soon as an ad-blocker blocks this file from loading we detect it's presence. 

== Screenshots ==

1. Notice overlay and notice displayed once ad blocker is detected.
